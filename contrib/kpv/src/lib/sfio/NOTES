	Change terror.h and the runtest script in Sfio_t to strictly
	use Sfio functions when running regression tests. Previously,
	sprintf and vsprintf from Stdio were used. This causes linkage
	problems on some architecture.

	sfsetbuf.c was changed to take a hint from sfsetbuf(f,f,blksz).
        blksz is used for aligning disk block boundary while reading data to
        optimize data transfer from disk (eg, via direct I/O). blksz can be
        at most f->size/2 so that data movement in buffer can be optimized.
        blksz should also be a power-of-2 for optimal disk seeks.

	features/common was changed so that the executable test to generate
	va_copy(), etc. will not dump core on certain platforms.

	sfmove() was fixed so that record definition is done via sfgetr().
	This clears up issue with partial records being multiply handled
	in different sfmove() calls.

	sfasprintf and sfvasprintf were added to reflect the new Stdio functions.

	Fix the use of argv.c and argv.i when processing %c in sfvprintf().

	Prototypes of *printf and *scanf functions were changed to return ssize_t
	instead of int. This breaks compatibility with Stdio but in some sense is
	more correct.

	Note that sfsync() raise the exception SFSYNC twice when SF_IOCHECK is on. 
	The first time with arg 1 before synchronization and the second time with
	arg 0, after synchronization. In this way, data squirelled away in disciplines
	can be flushed out as needed. This is needed in the Vczip program.
