We have taken the tail command from FreeBSD and ripped out all 
of the forward function to implement our version of toc. It only 
accepts -[n]n [file] as parms.  

The reason we must do this is that forward.c depends on BSD kernel
events and those dont exist under Linux, or Sun (And Ive not even 
tried SGI).

Its never easy.

Then we get to solaris which seems to have no support for err() warn()
family of functions.  So, Ive implemented a small set of dummies 
that indicate an error and abort as is needed and let the user know
that something bad happened, but because the system does not support
the functions they will not know exactly what went wrong.

Seems that Irix has the same issues with err/warn funcitons.  Maybe its 
just that they are old. Who knows, but we cope.

----------------- original plan; aborted because Linux sucks -------------
This is tail from the FreeBSD src tools. It is being used
nearly unchanged and is included because the tail with Linux
does not support the -r option that several of our tools
require.  

The tool is built with mk, but the original make file, 
and other source files from */usr.bin/tail have been kept
here for reference should we need it.

Small modifications needed to make the tool compile under
O/Ss other than FreeBSD:
	1) The __FBSDID macro must be ifdeffed out if not 
		compiling on FreeBSD
